This repository is a collection of my projects from Dataquest.io's platform. 
Goal is to familiarize myself with Data Science techniques:
* Data preprocessing.
* Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, and Feature Engineering
* Algorrithmic tradeoffs and Model Selection
* Deployment
Essentially, familiarizing myself with the entire Data Science pipeline.
Projects below depict my learnings and for those who are interested.

Projects are well commented with storyline/comments and my understanding of each project.
