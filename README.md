This repository is a collection of my projects from Dataquest.io's platform. 
Goal is to familiarize myself with Data Science techniques:
* Data preprocessing.
* Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, and Feature Engineering
* Algorrithmic tradeoffs and Model Selection
* Deployment
Essentially, familiarizing myself with the entire Data Science pipeline.
Projects below depict my learnings and for those who are interested.

Projects are well commented with storyline/comments and my understanding of each project.

## Project #1: Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys
## Project #2: Analyzing NYC High School Data
## Project #3: Creating a Kaggle Workflow
## Project #4: Predicting Bike Rentals
## Project #5: Predicting House Sale Prices
## Project #6: Visualizing Earnings based on College Majors
KeyTakeaways:
* Pandas has wrapper of matplotlib for convenient and quick plotting.
* Specifying 'kind' for plot and accessing feature cols very quickly with ease.
* We also plotted via matplotlib but we can clearly see it's a bit more code, i.e. we needed to extract the col values and set the X and Y values for plt.
* Infered several salary based questions just from Visualizing the various features in the dataset from the **American Community Survey**
